# pySource: Keysight Signal Generator Control
pySource is a collection of Python classes and functions that provide basic signal creation, instrument configuration, and waveform download capabilities for Keysight signal sources. 
It is loosely based on Keysight's IQ Tools, a Matlab-based toolkit that accomplishes similar things. 
pySource was built to satisfy the needs of signal generator users who don't have or want to use Matlab and to improve code readability and documentation.
